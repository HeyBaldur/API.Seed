# Versioning an API - ASP.NET CORE API 5.0
### Steps to version an API.
Versioning is a crucial part of API design. It gives developers the ability to improve their API without breaking the clientâ€™s applications when new updates are rolled out.
There are four main strategies we can use for versioning:

    1.	Version through URL
    2.	Version through query string
    3.	Version through the header
    4.	Version through Content-Type

###  Add API versions in Swagger

Follow these below steps to add API versions into your Swagger page.
Install required NuGet packages into your API project:

    Microsoft.AspnetCore.Mvc.Versioning
    Microsoft.AspnetCore.Mvc.Versioning.ApiExplorer
